      Hi! I'm Anton, I'm 18 years old and I'm from Vinnytsia, Ukraine.
      It's such a cool place to live here. I like playing competitive
      video games such as Quake and swiming on canoe with my brother
      and two sisters.

      I'm currently working as a full-stack (Angular) developer where
      I enjoy creating awesome projects with a great team. What I like
      the most about BYU-Idaho is that it is fully online and I can
      get a good education from anywhere in the world. Hope it will be
      an awesome course with you all :)
