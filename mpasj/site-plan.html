        The MolkyPolky's arena fps journey began in the year of 2020. My friend told me that there
        is some special kind of shooters that have very high skill ceiling and pretty fun to play once you start mastering them.
        After downloading the most released arena fps game called diabotical for the first time I got very interested in them
        and continued my exploration with the quake series. I have tried to play Quake Champions where I could see pretty beautiful
        graphics and play with a wide variety of interesting champions. After I tried Quake Live where I first time started the main
        competitive mode in arena fps - duel. It was pretty hard to so I went to play a lot of FFA there to get the hang of it. 
        Then Diabotical was finally released and I could play in a very active game and see the competitive side of this genre firstly 
        in a live setting where I saw how deep those matches are at the highest level, yet looked simple for those who were never familiar 
        with the game. Unfortunately, the game started dying pretty fast after its release, but I wanted to continue my exploration in this genre. 
        One day I saw a video in YouTube where was showcased a duel in-game called Quake 4. I started watching more games of it and decided to download the game and try it out. 
        This game has very unique movement in afps genre thanks to its crouch slide, and it got me pretty addicted to this movement pretty fast. After six months of playing the game,
        I met my friend drejjk who wanted to tell me what it takes to become a really high-level player in arena fps. And so I started my training. There are a lot of different concepts 
        in a duel like timing, positioning, weapon choice, tracking enemy position/stack/weapons, prediction, being unpredictable, dodging, dealing damage (that is the most important aspect in any high-level game),
        and many more. After training for more than one and a half years I improved my gameplay and game sense a lot. My aim/movement got better, but still, there is still big room for improvement. 
        While playing Quake 4, I also discovered the first game in this genre called QuakeWorld which is still pretty active to this day. This game has the most competitive team-based mode - 4on4 tdm. 
        There I started improving as a team player which takes also a lot of effort. This game has some of the nicest communities I have met in arena afps.
