      <h2>The History</h2>
      <h3>Beginning</h3>
      <p>
        The MolkyPolky's arena fps journey began in the year of 2020.
        My friend told me that there is some special kind of shooters
        that have very high skill ceiling and pretty fun to play once
        you start mastering them. After downloading the most released
        arena fps game called Diabotical for the first time I got very
        interested in them and continued my exploration with the quake
        series. I have tried to play Quake Champions where I could see
        pretty beautiful graphics and play with a wide variety of
        interesting champions. After I tried Quake Live where I first
        time started the main competitive mode in arena fps - duel. It
        was pretty hard to so I went to play a lot of FFA there to get
        the hang of it. Then Diabotical was finally released and I
        could play in a very active game and see the competitive side
        of this genre firstly in a live setting where I saw how deep
        those matches are at the highest level, yet looked simple for
        those who were never familiar with the game.
      </p>
      <h3>Quake 4</h3>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, the game started dying pretty fast after its
        release, but I wanted to continue my exploration in this
        genre. One day I saw a video in YouTube where was showcased a
        duel in-game called Quake 4. I started watching more games of
        it and decided to download the game and try it out. This game
        has very unique movement in arena fps genre thanks to its
        crouch slide, and it got me pretty addicted to this movement
        pretty fast. After six months of playing the game, I met my
        friend drejjk who wanted to tell me what it takes to become a
        really high-level player in arena fps. And so I started my
        training. There are a lot of different concepts in a duel like
        timing, positioning, weapon choice, tracking enemy
        position/stack/weapons, prediction, being unpredictable,
        dodging, dealing damage (that is the most important aspect in
        any high-level game), and many more. After training for more
        than one and a half years I improved my game play and game
        sense a lot. My aim/movement got better, but still, there is
        still big room for improvement.
      </p>
      <h3>QuakeWorld</h3>
      <p>
        While playing Quake 4, I also discovered the first game in
        this genre called QuakeWorld which is still pretty active to
        this day. This game has the most competitive team-based mode -
        4on4 tdm. There I started improving as a team player which
        takes also a lot of effort. This game has some of the nicest
        communities I have met in arena afps.

      <h3>More to Come</h3>
      <p>
        And so my journey continues with improving my level of game
        and of course spending time with all my friends that I have
        made here.
