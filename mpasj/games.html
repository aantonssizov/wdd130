      <h2>Quake Champions</h2>
      <img src="images/Cover_Art_of_Quake_Champions.jpg" alt="QC" />
      <p>
        Quake Champions currently is the most active and popular arena
        fps game. There are ongoing professional tournaments. Unlike
        other arena fps games QC features champions where each
        champion can significantly change the way you play the game.
        The cons of it are that it is purely optimized, there is no
        custom servers/maps/modes like in other arena fps.
      </p>
      <h2>Quake Live</h2>
      <img src="images/Quakelive_logo_300.png" alt="QL" />
      <p>
        Quake Live is second most popular quake. It has optimized
        engine and net-code. Features Quake 3 game play that is more
        tactical and you can calculate everything here and it always
        makes interesting duels there.
      </p>
      <h2>Quake 4</h2>
      <img src="images/Quake_4_cover.jpg" alt="Quake 4" />
      <p>
        Quake 4 features quake 3-like game play with addition of
        crouch slides and also slow weapon respawn like in Quake 2.
        This combination makes the game very fast yet tactical. This
        also has the best version of ctf here thanks to crouch slide.
        Unfortunately it is the least active game in the genre and has
        not so good net-code as in other games.
      </p>
      <h2>QuakeWorld</h2>
      <img src="images/Quake1cover.jpg" alt="QuakeWorld" />
      <p>
        Quake World is the first ever arena fps released back in 1996
        and still active game thanks to being open source. It is also
        the fastest quake out there. Also has the best team mode arena
        fps 4on4 thanks to its deep tactics.
