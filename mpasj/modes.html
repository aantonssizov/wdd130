      <h4>Duel</h4>
      <p>
        Duel is the main competitive mode in any arena fps. Usually,
        it has a 10-minute time limit. The player who makes more frags
        as his opponent wins. The game has many concepts and the main
        ones are item timings, positioning, dealing damage, and
        dodging.

      <h4>TDM 2vs2</h4>
      <p>
        2v2 is like duel but a with a teammate. It's more aim based
        than a duel. It's less stressful as you play not alone. And
        starting from this mode you also have quad damage - a power-up
        that can change how the game will go.

      <h4>TDM 4v4</h4>
      <p>
        4v4 is also played like a duel but you play as a team of four
        which adds a new important skill being a team player.

      <h4>CTF 4v4/5v5</h4>
      <p>
        CTF is like tdm but with objective - flags. The goal of each
        team is to capture the enemy flag and return back to your flag
        with it. Usually, players are separated into roles such as
        defense, middle, and attack.

      <h4>FFA</h4>
      <p>
        FFA or DM is you versus everyone. The player who scored the
        most frags wins. It is the best mode to learn the basics of
        arena fps games. And of course, you can make a lot of cool
        frag streaks with quads :)
